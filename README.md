## A machine learning model to predict the mass of quasar SMBHs
The net comprises three Conv1D layers (the middle one with a batch normalization) followed by two LSTM layers and then two Dense layers.  


The files and folders are as follows:
- `Quasar_mass_ML.ipynb`, the main program file to run, a Jupyter iPython file;
- this `README.md` file;
- `get_Chen_data.py`, a script file;
- `quasar_analysis.py`, another script file;
- a `models` folder for `hdf5` files in two folders:
  - an **empty** `checkpoints` folder where checkpoints automatically generated by the ANN in ... will be placed; and
  - a `Best_models` folder where the best ANN model is kept with its two different sets of optimizers and weights.  There are two files for the best model:
     - `Best_ANN_intermediate_stage.h5` which has the intermediate weights from the 1e-3 learning rate model run; and
     - `Best_ANN_final_stage.h5` which is the <ins>model to use for prediction</ins>, having the final weights from the 1e-5 learning rate model run;
- a `data` folder, containing:
  - `apjsab41fet1_mrt.txt` which is the Chen+ data file from https://iopscience.iop.org/0067-0049/244/2/36/suppdata/apjsab41fet1_mrt.txt;
  - a 'bigger_data` folder containing:
     - `quasars.parquet` which is created from the Chen+ data file and SDSS data.


To create the `quasars.parquet` and `spectra.parquet` files from scratch, download to `bigger_data` an SDSS data file https://data.sdss.org/sas/dr16/eboss/qso/DR16Q/DR16Q_v4.fits, which is described on the relevant [SDSS datamodel webpage](https://dr16.sdss.org/datamodel/files/BOSS_QSO/DR16Q/DR16Q_v4.html).  Follow instructions in the second cell of `Quasar_mass_ML.ipynb`.
